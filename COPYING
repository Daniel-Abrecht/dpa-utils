Unless stated otherwise, all files are released unter the MIT license.
This includes this library, the generated binaries, and all it's source code.
A copy of the MIT license is provided in the LICENSE.MIT file alongside this document.

There is currently also a copy of the unicode data files included in this project.
These files are located in the folder `external/unicode/`. They have been taken from
https://www.unicode.org/Public/16.0.0/ucd/UCD.zip.

The unicode data files files are licensed under the UNICODE LICENSE V3.
A copy of the license can be found in the LICENSE.UNICODE file.
In case you want to update them in the future, take a look at https://www.unicode.org/ucd/
and https://www.unicode.org/copyright.html, and update the information in this file as needed.

The library itself does not require the unicode data files nor any files derived from them,
and they are not used to build the library, but the library does load files derived from
the unicode data files if they are available at runtime when the library is loaded by a program.
If those files are not available, some functions may be limited.

The files derived from the unicode data files are located in the folder `data/unicode/`.
They are generated using the script `script/ucd2bin.py`. Because the files in `data/unicode/`
are derived from the unicode data files, they are licensed using the same license the
unicode data files are.
